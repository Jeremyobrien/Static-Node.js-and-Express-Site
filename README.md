# Static Node.js and Express Site
My first attempt at writing "server-side" JavaScript.

In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase my projects.  The site contains a modern landing page, an about page, and a series of project pages to show off and detail the first five projects from my Techdegree.

* I created a JSON file to store all the data about my projects.

* Used Pug to complete templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

* Used Node.js and Express to:
  *Import the required dependencies
  *Link the JSON with the Pug templates
  *Set up routes to handle requests
  *Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
  *Handle errors
  *Set up a server to serve the project

This project helped me develop a comfortable working knowledge of Node.js, Express and Pug, setting up a server, handling requests, working with server-side JavaScript, and building a powerful and modern back end project.
